# Getting started with Slack Apps 
Slack apps allow you to extend and customize your Slack workspaces with fun and usual interactions.

## Prerequisites

Bolt app template
=================

[Bolt](https://slack.dev/bolt) is a development framework that lets you build JavaScript-based Slack apps in a flash.

This project is a simple app template to make it easy to create your first Bolt app.

Your Project
------------

- `app.js` contains the primary Bolt app. It imports the Bolt package (`@slack/bolt`) and starts the Bolt app's server. It's where you'll add your app's listeners.
- `.env` is where you'll put your Slack app's authorization token and signing secret.
- The `examples/` folder contains a couple of other sample apps that you can peruse to your liking. They show off a few platform features that your app may want to use.
